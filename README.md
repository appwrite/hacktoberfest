## 👩‍💻 Contributing

Like with every GitHub project, contributing starts with cloning this repository. You can either use the `code` button at the top of this page, or the `git clone` command as follows

```sh
git clone git@github.com:appwrite/hacktoberfest.git
cd hacktoberfest
```

Then, install the dependencies using 
```sh
npm install
```

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## 🔨 Building

Before creating a production version of the app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
